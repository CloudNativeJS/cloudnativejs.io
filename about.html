  <h1>CloudNativeJS</h1>

  <p>
    Node.js applications are overwhelmingly being deployed to clouds, with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/user-survey-report/#Where-Deploy-Code">79%</a> of Node.js developers reporting using cloud providers for their production applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/user-survey-report/#tab20_5">almost half</a> are using Docker, only <a href=" https://evansdata.com/reports/viewRelease.php?reportID=27
      ">21%</a> of developers are building “Cloud Native” applications, and just <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/user-survey-report/#tab20_5
      ">12%</a> are using container orchestration technologies like Kubernetes.
  </p>
  <p>
    CloudNativeJS is an open source community project that aims to provide best-practices, assets and tools to make it easier to get started building enterprise-grade, Cloud Native Node.js applications. These are not just cloud-hosted, but integrate with
    the <a href="http://cncf.io ">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a> open source technologies and exploit the full potential that cloud platforms provide.
  </p>

  <h2>CloudNativeJS Assets.</h2>

  <p>The CloudNativeJS project currently provides the following, backed by the <a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS ">CloudNativeJS</a> repository on GitHub. This set is expected to extend over time to include not just a wider set of CNCF technologies,
    but to also include DevOps best practices.

    <h3><a href="http://modules.cloudnativejs.io ">Node.js Module Insights</a></h3>
    <p>
      For a core set of commonly used or specifically cloud-native technologies, including those provided by this project, CloudNativeJS’s <a href="http://modules.cloudnativejs.io ">module insights</a> constantly runs testing, verification and analysis
      against all current LTS versions of Node.js, across a wide set of operating systems and architectures. Module insights additionally checks and reports code coverage and verifies the license contained in the module and all of its dependencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allows application developers to easily and consistently view the state of a range of modules across the platforms that they use, and for the CloudNativeJS community to work with module owners where there are test failures to get those resolved quickly.
    </p>
  </p>
  The set of modules analysed is intended to expand over time, based on feedback and requests from the community and module owners. See <a href="#contributing">Contributing to the CloudNativeJS Community</a> below.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/ModuleLTS ">Node.js Module LTS Policy</a></h3>
  <p>
    The CloudNativeJS project also provides a "<a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/ModuleLTS">Module LTS Policy</a>" based on the LTS policy for Node.js itself. This policy is designed to provide clarity to both module owners and module consumers
    around how long essential fixes should be provided on previous major versions once a new major version has been released.
  </p>
  <p>
    This has been adopted for all modules provided by the CloudNativeJS project, as well as those provided from a growing list of other module owners. Eventually it is hoped that this approach will become the Node.js community standard for any module that
    wishes to provide an LTS policy, making the meaning of Node.js Module LTS consistent across modules.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/docker">Template Dockerfiles</a></h3>
  <p>
    The “docker” repository provides a set of <a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/docker">template Dockerfiles</a> that implement the best-practices for building development, debug, test and production Docker images for your applications. These can
    easily be modified and applied to any Node.js application.
  </p>
  <h3><a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/helm">Template Helm Charts</a></h3>
  <p>
    The “helm” repository provides a <a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/helm">template Helm chart</a> that simplifies the process of taking a Docker image of your application and deploying it to Kubernetes along with configuration for replicas and
    autoscaling. Additionally the templates provide configuration for using liveness and readiness based Health Checking, Prometheus metrics, OpenTracing with Zipkin, and support for using additional cloud-native technologies like Istio.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/cloud-health-connect">Health Check Support</a></h3>
  <p>The “<a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/cloud-health">cloud-health</a>” and “<a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/cloud-health-connect">cloud-health-connect</a>” repositories provide NPM modules for managing and reporting the lifecycle of
    your application through readiness and liveness endpoints. These are used by Kubernetes to determine whether your application is ready to receive requests, whether it is no-longer “live” and should be automatically restarted, and to handle graceful
    shutdown when it is requested to stop.
  </p>

  <h3><a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/appmetrics-prometheus">Prometheus Monitoring</a></h3>
  <p>
    The “<a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/appmetrics-prometheus">appmetrics-prometheus</a>” repository provides an NPM module for collecting metric data from your application. The metrics gathered range from resource metrics such as CPU and memory,
    to application level metrics such as HTTP request responsiveness. These are then exposed as an application endpoint, and through a configuration in the Helm charts, the metrics are automatically collected by a deployment of the Prometheus open source
    monitoring project.
  </p>


  <h3><a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/appmetrics-zipkin">OpenTracing Request Tracking</a></h3>
  <p>
    The “<a href="http://github.com/CloudNativeJS/appmetrics-zipkin">appmetrics-zipkin</a>” repository provides an NPM module for instrumenting your application with OpenTracing based request tracking, allowing you to monitor requests across microservces
    and applications. The tracking data is then sent to a deployment of the Zipkin open source request tracking project.
  </p>
